    <h1>The Hipster in the Mirror</h1>
    <h2>Mark Greif</h2>
    <p>A year ago, my colleagues and I started to investigate the contemporary hipster. What was the "hipster," and what did it mean to be one? It was a puzzle. No one, it seemed, thought of himself as a hipster, and when someone called you a hipster, the term was an insult. Paradoxically, those who used the insult were themselves often said to resemble hipsters - they wore the skinny jeans and big eyeglasses, gathered in tiny enclaves in big cities, and looked down on mainstream fashions and "tourists." Most puzzling was how rattled sensible, down-to-earth people became when we posed hipster-themed questions. When we announced a public debate on hipsterism, I received e-mail messages both furious and plaintive. Normally inquisitive people protested that there could be no answer and no definition.
    Maybe hipsters didn't exist! The responses were more impassioned than those we'd had in our discussions on health care, young conservatives and feminism. And perfectly blameless individuals began flagellating themselves: "Am I a hipster?"
    <br> <br>

    I wondered if I could guess the root of their pain. It's a superficial topic, yet it seemed that so much was at stake. Why? Because struggles over taste (and "taste" is the hipsters primary currency) are never (Think of Paris Hilton in her trucker nat.)
    <br> <br>
    Both groups, meanwhile, look down on the couch-surfing, old-clothes-wearing hipsters who seem most authentic but are also often the most socially precarious - the lower-middle-class young, moving up through style, but with no backstop of parental culture or family capital. They are the bartenders and boutique clerks who wait on their well-to-do peers and wealthy tourists. Only on the basis of their cool clothes can they be "superior": hipster knowledge compensates for economic immobility.
    <br> <br>
    All hipsters play at being the inventors or first adopters of novelties: pride comes from knowing, and deciding, what?'s cool in advance of the rest of the world. Yet the habits of hatred and accusation are endemic to hipsters because they feel the weakness of everyone's position - including their own. Proving that someone is trying desperately to boost himself instantly undoes him as an opponent. He's a fake, while you are a natural aristocrat of taste. That's why "He's not for real, he's just a hipster" is a potent insult among all the people identifiable as hipsters themselves.
    <br> <br>
    The attempt to analyze the hipster provokes such universal anxiety because it calls everyone's bluff. And hipsters aren' the only ones unnerved. Many of us try to justify our privileges by pretending that our superb tastes and intellect prove we deserve them, reflecting our inner superiority. Those below us economically, the reasoning goes, don't appreciate what we do; similarly, they couldn't fill our jobs, handle our wealth or survive our difficulties. Of course this is a terrible lie. And Bourdieu devoted his life to exposing it. Those who read him in effect become responsible to him - forced to admit a failure to examine our own lives, down to the seeming trivialities of clothes and distinction that, as Bourdieu revealed, also structure our world.</p>
